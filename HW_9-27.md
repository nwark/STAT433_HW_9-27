\#Question 1

How many flights have a missing dep\_time?

``` r
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
  summarise(num_missing = n())
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   num_missing
    ##         <int>
    ## 1        8255

8255

What other variables are
    missing?

``` r
names(which(colSums(is.na(flights))>0))
```

    ## [1] "dep_time"  "dep_delay" "arr_time"  "arr_delay" "tailnum"   "air_time"

What might these rows represent?

These row are most likely either canceled flights because there is no
depature time and no arrival time, or flights that had to change the
destination mid flight due to there being a departure time but not an
arrival time.

\#Question 2

Currently dep\_time and sched\_dep\_time are convenient to look at, but
hard to compute with because theyâ€™re not really continuous numbers.
Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes
since midnight.

``` r
new_flights = flights %>% 
  mutate(dep_time = 60*(dep_time%/%100) + dep_time%%100,
         sched_dep_time = 60*(sched_dep_time%/%100) + sched_dep_time%%100)

new_flights
```

\#Question 3

Look at the number of canceled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is
the proportion of canceled flights related to the average delay? Use
multiple dyplr operations, all on one line, concluding with
ggplot(aes(x= ,y=)) + geom\_point()

avg\_delay is the average of both departure delay and arrival delay
combined

``` r
flights %>% 
  mutate(month_day = paste(month, day, sep = "/")) %>% 
  group_by(month_day) %>% 
  summarise(num_cancelled = sum(is.na(dep_delay)),
            avg_delay = (sum(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE) + sum(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) / (sum(!is.na(dep_delay)) + sum(!is.na(arr_delay)))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=num_cancelled, y=avg_delay)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', color='red', se=FALSE) + 
  labs(x='Number of Cancelled Flights per Day', y ='Average Delay', title = 'Cancelled Flights per Day vs. Average Delay per Day', subtitle = 'Blue line is smooth line, red line is linear regression line')
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

There is a positive correlation between the number of cancelled flights
per day and the average delay. The correlation looks to be logarithmic.
